# Purpose: The purpose of this daemonset is to allow the nf_nat_tftp module
# to be loaded by the running kernel on all nodes that are candidates for
# accepting ingress traffic into the network. Typically, this includes
# worker nodes, but can include master nodes if the master taint is
# removed. In BGP mode, this means any node that can serve as a speaker
# should load this module.
#
# This is implemented as a daemonset and not a job, because a daemonset
# is resilient to reboot operations. This is the quickest possible
# solution currently available for re-establishing a route to the TFTP
# pods in question, especially given nodes that miss the window of
# opportunity for tftp download often find themselves into a UEFI shell.
